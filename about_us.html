			Sheepish Wolf brewery was founded in 2016 by two eager beer enthusiasts when they were given
            a web design project that would shape destiny.
            <br /><br />
            The small brewhouse located in Dublin, Ireland has two large brew kettles and a 100 square feet
            storage facility with the highest standards.
            <br /><br />
            The first beer to be brewed in the Sheepish Wolf brewery was the Original Sheepish Wolf Lager.
            It was recently awarded the Freshest New Craft Beer (Lager) award and is grossing over two million euro this year.
            <br /><br />
            After a successful start to the craft beer game Sheepish Wolf also introduced an Ale and IPA version
            to attract new audiences. The two new types have been well received and have also been awarded several 
            local awards including the Hippest New Craft Beer(IPA) of Ireland and the world.
            <br /><br />
            After the two successful new additions the latest new invention to be added to the list of products 
            was the Sheepish Wolf Stout. 
            <br /><br />
            Sheepish Wolf is currently only sold in designated bars, from the factory itself and in selected stores 
            in Ireland. However, the plan for 2017 is to go global with the Lager at the beginning of the year 
            and release the rest of the products in selected countries towards the end of 2017
